# Recommendations:

Based on the findings, the following recommendations are made:

- Industries like tech, which are vulnerable to economic shifts, should diversify their talent pool to adapt to changes in market conditions.

- Governments and policymakers in India should focus on supporting metro cities like Bangalore and Mumbai, where layoffs are most concentrated.

- With layoffs concentrated in the tech sector, there should be increased emphasis on reskilling and upskilling employees to prepare them for new roles in emerging industries.

- Companies should establish improved tracking and forecasting systems to better anticipate market changes. This will help them prepare for potential downturns and lessen the impact of large layoffs.
